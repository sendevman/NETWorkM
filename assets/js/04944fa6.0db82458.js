The ARP table is a list of all IP addresses and the corresponding MAC addresses of the devices on the network. When a device needs to send data to a specific IP address, it first checks its ARP table to see if it already has the MAC address for that IP address. If the MAC address is not found in the ARP table, the device will send a broadcast message called an ARP request to the network asking which device owns that IP address. The device that owns the IP address will then respond with its MAC address, and the requesting device will update its ARP table with the new mapping.
