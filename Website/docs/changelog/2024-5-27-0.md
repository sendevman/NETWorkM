**System requirements**

- Windows 10 / Server x64 (1809 or later)
- [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.0 (LTS) - x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime)

## Breaking Changes

- Installer has been changed from `exe` (`InnoSetup`) to `msi` (`WiX Toolset`) in order to support deep signing of the binaries. [#2705](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/pull/2705)

  :::info

  The MSI installer will attempt to automatically uninstall the previous version of NETworkManager.

  :::

  :::warning

  The MSI installer published on 24.05.2024 (preview) had an error in the uninstall routine. If you have problems with the uninstallation or the current update, first reinstall the version [2024.4.21.0 (direct download of the setup)](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/releases/download/2024.4.21.0/NETworkManager_2024.4.21.0_Setup.exe). You can then run the MSI installation programme to update to the latest version.

  :::

## What's new?

- The binaries and the installer (`.msi`) are now signed with a free code signing certificate from [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/). Thanks to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) for providing free code signing for open source projects. [#2705](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/pull/2705)
