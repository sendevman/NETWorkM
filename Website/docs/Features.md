## Profiles

Save your hosts with specific configurations in profiles and use them across all features. You can seperate them in different profile files for each environment (e.g. work, home, customer, etc.) and encrypt them with a master password to protect your sensitive data.

## Languages

Thanks to the community, NETworkManager is available in more than 15 [languages](https://app.transifex.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/dashboard/). If you would like to help with the translation and improve it, you can join the translation team on [Transifex](https://app.transifex.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/dashboard/).

New languages must be requested on GitHub via a [feature request](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/issues/new/choose) before you can join the translation team and start translating.

See also the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.
