# Download

SHA256: `823D49F2EE0FD0C41AEE887E48729D724F722253D9EFBC7DB8AF19A4420D99B8`

The software is portable by default. Simply unpack the ZIP archive and put the files somewhere the windows user has write permissions.

_On Windows 10 systems, SmartScreen may prevent the execution of the_ `NETworkManger.exe`. _This happens because the binary is not digitaly signed. To open it anyway, click in the dialog on "More info" then click the button "Run anyway"._
