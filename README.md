   ```PowerShell
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/sendevman/NETManager

   # Navigate to the repository
   cd NETManager

   # Clone the submodules
   git submodule update --init
   ```

3. Open the project file `.\Source\NETManager.sln` with Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider to build (or debug)
   the solution.

   > **ALTERNATIVE**
   >
   > With the following commands you can directly build the binaries from the command line:
   >
   > ```PowerShell
   > dotnet restore .\Source\NETManager.sln
   >
   > dotnet build .\Source\NETManager.sln --configuration Release --no-restore

## Code Signing Policy

NETManager uses free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) and a free code signing certificate
from [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

The binaries and installer are built on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sendevman/NETManager) directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sendevman/NETManager/blob/main/appveyor.yml).
Build artifacts are automatically sent to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) via webhook, where they are signed after manual approval by the maintainer.
The signed binaries are then uploaded to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/sendevman/NETManager/releases) page.

## Privacy Policy

This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it.

NETManager has integrated the following services for additional functions, which can be enabled or disabled at the first start (in the welcome dialog) or at any time in the settings:

- [api.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) (Check for program updates)
- [ipify.org](https://www.ipify.org/) (Retrieve the public IP address used by the client)
- [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/docs/legal) (Retrieve network information such as geo location, ISP, DNS resolver used, etc. used by the client)
