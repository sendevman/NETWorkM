The software is portable by default, simply unpack the ZIP archive and save it in a folder you have write permissions on.

_On Windows 10 systems, SmartScreen may prevent the execution of the_ `NETworkManger.exe` _, because the binary is not digitaly signed. To open it anyway, click in the dialog on "More info" then click the button "Run anyway"._
