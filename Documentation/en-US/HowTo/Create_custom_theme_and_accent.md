# How to create a custom theme and accent?

Since version 1.5.0.0, you can create custom designs that are compatible with [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro).

Own designs are stored in the program folder under `themes`.

## Theme

Download a theme for MahApps.Metro (eg [Black](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/blob/master/Source/NETworkManager/Themes/Black.Theme.xaml), [White](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/blob/master/Source/NETworkManager/Themes/White.Theme.xaml)) and modify the values as you like. Save the file in the `themes` folder with the following filename `CUSTOMNAME.Theme.xaml`.

After restarting the application, you can load the theme in the program settings.

## Accent

Download an accent for MahApps.Metro (eg [Black](https://github.com/BornToBeRoot/NETworkManager/blob/master/Source/NETworkManager/Themes/Black.Accent.xaml)) and modify the values as you like. Save the file in the `themes` folder with the following file name `CUSTOMNAME.Accent.xaml`.

After restarting the application, you can load the accent in the program settings.
